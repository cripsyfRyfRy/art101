				<ol>
					<li>Take input from player</li>
					<li>Player can choose from rock paper or scissors, validate user input.</li> 
					<li>Computer generates their move.</li>
					<li>Evaluate possible combinations.</li>
					<li>If the combination is the same it’s a tie and the player puts a new input.</li>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to understand how to psuedocode and to undertsand how it can be helpful when problem solving.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem I had was understanding what we had to do complete the lab. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After understanding what had to be done It was failry easy to complete. I was just confused of what exactly had to be added to the HTML file and what exactly wanted to be turned in. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>

						<p>pseudocode on how to play Apex Legends</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Turn on the computer</li>
								<li>Log into the user</li>
								<li>Open up Steam app</li>
								<li>Log into Steam</li>

								<li>Click the “Ready” button located in the bottom left corner</li>
								<li>Choose a legend</li>
								<li>Determine where to land</li>
								<li>Press space to leave the drop ship</li>
								<li>When you land at a designated area, find loot and weapons</li>
								<li>If you are not in the zone, move into the safe zone</li>
								<li>If other players land in the same spot as you, quickly search for a weapon to kill the enemies</li>
								<li>Loot the enemy's bodies and you kill them</li>
								<li>If there are enemies in the zone you can choose to engage or disengage</li>
								<li>Repeat previous step until you die or win the game</li>
