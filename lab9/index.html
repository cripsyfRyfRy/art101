			<h1>Lab 9: Libraries & jQuery</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to practice using jQuery and to learn how to create buttons to change the webdsite at will.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We ran into a couple issue with the buttons. It took us a while to find a viable solution since for a while the buttons were not responding cause they were being overwritten for some reason </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a more challenging lab for sure. My partner and I were stumped for a while but ulrimately figured out a solution. I liked being able to learn how to crrate buttons and the use of jQuery is pretty fun so I can;t wait to see the stuff I can make with it. </p>
