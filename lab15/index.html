					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to understand how to use ajax and how to use API's in our code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For this lab my partner and I had issues when it came to getting the api and the button working it took us a while to understand how it worked  and how to get it working</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this was a good lab but ultiamtely pretty diffcult since ajax and api's are a bit confusin. </p>
