					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to add an api that has a comic that changes everyday.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The one problem I ran into was of course working with the api. I struggle with them a bit, they can be a bit hard to undertsnad. I also ran into a problem with the CORS extention because I forgot you needed it but ultimately got it to work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this was an interetsing lab and it was cool to implement an API that changes ervyday and being able to look at the previous comics. </p>
