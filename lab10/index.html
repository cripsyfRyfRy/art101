					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a button that would create random text.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This was fairly easy lab. My partner and I did not run into to many problems. The only problem I ran into was for task x where I struggled to have the text go from left from right.  </p>
