			<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was using loops to create a sorting hat that would be able to take the users name and sort them into the house.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This was a quick and fairly easy lab for my partner and I. We got through it pretty fast. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I remember doing loops in the past and they would always mess me up because by adding one thing sometimes you got make so many more statements, it is easy to lose track of what yo uneed and don't need. Sometimes the code can become messy and hard to read. </p>
